title: The rule of 100
description: How to do whatever in 100 times
---

I read [https://www.unknown-unknowns.xyz/p/unknown-unknowns-90-how-can-we-create](https://www.unknown-unknowns.xyz/p/unknown-unknowns-90-how-can-we-create) and got inspired.

This part especially is as clear cut as can be:

> The “Do It 100 times” exercise is a great way to create and it helps to combat perfectionism.

And 

> Do it 100 times. Write 100 songs, cook 100 omelettes, talk to 100 people. It never seems like a huge deal until you try it yourself. It’s manageable, and yet it stretches you, and you’ll be observably different at the end of it. Effective way to get a foothold on a new thing.

This idea seems to be low-threshold enough to just do it.

And the following are the main benefits I hope to attain (based on the article):
* Find out what I like and don't like
* Create without judgement

I hope to stop filtering and start producing. There will be days when nothing comes out, there will be days when I hate what comes out. As the post says: I'll quickly realize that the world didn’t end and maybe the next day it will be better. Also reminds me of a post by [my favorite businesscoach for writers](https://brutalekraai.nl/): sometimes when you open a faucet, muddy water comes out. You should not close the faucet, you should just let it run until clear water comes out. Same goes for creating: it might be crap, but who knows what comes after? Just keep it running. 


## The plan

I have a list of 'ideas': more or less precise ideas about tools that I could build that could help make something easier. 
A few examples:

* [team lineup](https://team-lineup.g2software.nl/)
* [buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) but then based on Tikkie
* send attachments to an email address which automatically stores them on a shared drive

So let's work on one such an idea for 10 minutes a day.  
Exceptions: Wednesdays (daddy day) and weekends.  
Counting today (Monday), this means I'll have done this 100 times after 25 weeks, which means it will be Friday Sep 8th.  
Taking holidays and such into account it will probably be 2-3 weeks later.
